# Lending Club Case Study
> Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss).
> Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.
> In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers
> labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. .
